#Lightning Jet#

##Background: 
  this project is a 2d platform shooting game call "lightning jet." The player will use "WSAD" to control a fighter jet object which spawns at bottom of the play screen and dodges enemy jets bullets. If the players jet got hit by enemy's bullet or had a collision with them, the player's jet will fall. Depending on whether if the player has any "life point" left, the fighter jet will be respawned.
The player's jet will be firing bullet automatically. Upon reaching certain scores, the player jet bullet will be upgraded. The goal is to defeat the boss jet which will be spawning as the game progressing.
