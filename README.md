The pixi.js library is used to rendering images, checking boundries and collision

## Production Timeline:
Friday Afternoon & Weekend: be able to render a basic gaming interface, with all jet spawn on the screen, add logic for jets to shoot bullets.
Monday: jets will spawn properly, user will have iframe upon respawn
Tuesday: add background, add sound effect.
Wednesday: add addition features like pause and mute
Thursday Morning: practicing presentation, sharping the project

## Future Implementations:
Adding sound effect
Adding player jet ability to cast ultimate(most likely a giant lazer which has more damage and it checks for collision at certain frame)
Adding more type of bullet for both player and enemy jet
